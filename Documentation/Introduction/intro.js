 * What is D3 ?
 * -------------
 * D3 stands for Data-Driven Documents. It is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Mike Bostock 
 * to create custom interactive data visualizations in the web browser using SVG, HTML and CSS.
 * With the massive amount of data being generated today, communicating this information is getting 
 * difficult. Visual representations of data are the most effective means of conveying meaningful 
 * information and D3 provides a great deal of ease and flexibility to create these data visualizations. 
 * It is dynamic, intuitive and needs minimum amount of effort. It is similar to Protovis in concept but 
 * while Protovis is used for static visualizations, D3 focuses more on interactions, transitions and 
 * transformations.

 * D3 Features
 * -------------
 * - Uses Web Standards: D3 is an extremely powerful visualization tool to create interactive data 
 *                       visualizations. It exploits the modern web standards: SVG, HTML and CSS to create 
 *                       data visualization.
 * - Data Driven: D3 is data driven. It can use static data or fetch it from the remote server in different 
 *                formats such as Arrays, Objects, CSV, JSON, XML etc. to create different types of charts.
 * - DOM Manipulation: D3 allows you to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) based on your data.
 * - Data Driven Elements: It empowers your data to dynamically generate elements and apply styles to the 
 *                         elements, be it a table, a graph or any other HTML element and/or group of 
 *                         elements.
 * - Dynamic Properties: D3 gives the flexibility to provide dynamic properties to most of its functions. 
 *                       Properties can be specified as functions of data. That means your data can drive 
 *                       your styles and attributes.
 * - Types of visualization: With D3, there are no standard visualization formats. But it enables you to 
 *                           create anything from an HTML table to a Pie chart, from graphs and bar charts 
 *                           to geospatial maps.
 * - Custom Visualizations: Since D3 works with web standards, it gives you complete control over your 
 *                          visualization features.
 * - Transitions: D3 provides the transition() function. This is quite powerful because internally, 
 *                D3 works out the logic to interpolate between your values and find the intermittent states.
 * - Interaction and animation: D3 provides great support for animation with functions like duration(), 
 *                              delay() and ease(). Animations from one state to another are fast and 
 *                              responsive to user interactions.

 * Advantages of D3
 * -----------------
 * - D3.js is a Javascript library. So, it can be used with any JS framework of your choice like Angular.js, 
 *   React.js or Ember.js.
 * - D3 focuses on data, so it is the most appropriate and specialized tool for data visualizations.
 * - D3 is open-source. So you can work with the source code and add your own features.
 * - It works with web standards so you don't need any other technology or plugin other than a browser 
 *   to make use of D3.
 * - D3 works with web standards like HTML, CSS and SVG, there is no new learning or debugging tool required 
 *   to work on D3.
 * - D3 does not provide any specific feature, so it gives you complete control over your visualization 
 *   to customize it the way you want. This gives it an edge over other popular tools like Tableau or 
 *   QlikView.
 * - Since D3 is lightweight, and works directly with web standards, it is extremely fast and works well 
 *   with large datasets.
